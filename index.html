It is used for morning assembly. At break time all the students of the classes come out of their classrooms and play there.
It is such a big ground that everyone can play any game he likes. Some play cricket while some play football. Some of the students like to play hockey.
Some play shooting which is throwing rubber ball at each other. All the activities end with the ringing of bell and all the students rush to the classrooms. I like my school playground because it provides me a place to play.</p>

They have a wide variety of applications in science, education, defense, business and many other sectors.

Computer education in school helps the children to get access to the extensive world of information. Students can find any information that they desire with the help of a computer. Almost every school nowadays has a computer lab of their own. Such labs are quite imperative in educating the children about the wise and efficient use of the computer.

   MCC launched the Chola MS Schools Premier League football tournament on Wednesday with a six. Five goals in a devastating nine-minute spell in the first half helped hosts MCC trounce Chettinad Vidyashram 6-0 in the opening match of the first-ever school league in Chennai.

In the second match of the day, Vidya Mandir got the better of Don Bosco (Perambur) 1-0 thanks to S. Gokul’s 35th minute winner.


 
 

The opening exchanges between MCC and Chettinad suggested that the match would be close. But Chettinad’s confident start ultimately proved to be a false dawn as they crumbled in the face of their opponents’ attacking play. MCC students, who had gathered at the ground in large numbers after their classes, enjoyed every bit of the football team’s dominant show.

MCC’s right-winger R. Prabhu tormented Chettinad throughout. He scored two and set up three in the first half as Chettinad’s defence fell apart. He formed an attacking trident with central midfielder R. Lokesh and left-winger H. Gulabh. No wonder Prabhu was adjudged man of the match.

This facility was upgraded as a Consulting Library in 1869, containing dictionaries, atlases, commentaries and books of Reference of every branch of knowledge. This was open for the students of the college for one hour before the commencement and two hours after the college was closed. In 1870 about 200 students had free access to the General Library, and over a thousand books were borrowed in a year. It was so efficiently managed that not a single volume was found missing. In 1871, Mrs Margaret Gunn of Latheron, Scotland endowed the Library with a sum of 1000 Pounds in memory of her husband Donald Gunn who died in 1869. The interest of this sum was made available for the maintenance of the Library. The Hunter   Commission on Education in 1882 gave a high commendation to the richness of the Library, along with that of the Presidency College. </p>

                     Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) 5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975) was an Indian academic, professor, philosopher, and politician[2] who served as the first Vice President of India (1952–1962) and the second President of India (1962–1967).[web 1]

One of India's most distinguished twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy,[3][web 2] after completing his education at Madras Christian College in 1911, he became Assistant Professor and later Professor of Philosophy at Madras Presidency College then subsequently Professor of Philosophy at the University of Mysore (1918–1921); the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921–1932) and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford (1936–1952) by which he became the first Indian to hold a professorial chair at the University of Oxford. He was Upton Lecturer at Manchester College, Oxford in 1926, 1929, and 1930. In 1930 he was appointed Haskell lecturer in Comparative Religion at the University of Chicago.[4]

His philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding.[web 2] He defended Hinduism against what he called "uninformed Western criticism",[5] contributing to the formation of contemporary Hindu identity.[6] He has been influential in shaping the understanding of Hinduism, in both India and the west, and earned a reputation as a bridge-builder between India and the West.[7]

Radhakrishnan was awarded several high awards during his life, including a knighthood in 1931, the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award in India, in 1954, and honorary membership of the British Royal Order of Merit in 1963. He was also one of the founders of Helpage India, a non profit organisation for elderly underprivileged in India. Radhakrishnan believed that "teachers should be the best minds in the country". Since 1962, his birthday has been celebrated in India as Teachers' Day on 5 September every year.[web 3]

He is the only President of India who could not attend the Delhi Republic Day parade due to his ill health.[8]
